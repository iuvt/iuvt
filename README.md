# Welcome to the official iuvt GitHub Profile!

I go by many names online, some of the most notable being; iuvt, prismo, nyxie, goldduck, and onzii.<br>

This profile was created to share some of my projects with the world, mainly Lua scripts for Roblox.<br>

## My Interests

Personally, I have always had a passion and interest in Computers and Coding, leading me to take it up at a young age, however<br>

I never had a usage for my skillset until now, where I have began scripting and coding various apps that I think will make<br>

mine and others' lives a lot easier, with easy to use environments (because I understand how annoying it is when you can't understand a program.<br>

<br>

I consider myself somewhat of a Video-Game enthusiast as I began playing them when I was about 3-4 years old (and still do today).<br>

however the concept of injecting your own code into the game was one of the largest interests for me at the time, and still is!
